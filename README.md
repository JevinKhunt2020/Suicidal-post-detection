# Suicide Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting suicidal tendencies in text data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It aims to identify and classify text that may indicate suicidal ideation, providing a tool that could potentially assist in mental health support and intervention.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns and insights in the dataset.
- **Modeling**: Training machine learning models to classify text based on its suicidal or non-suicidal nature.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance of the trained models to ensure reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations.
  - `sklearn`: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.
  - `nltk`/`spacy`: Natural language processing.
  - `matplotlib`/`seaborn`: Data visualization.

## How to Use
1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `Suicide_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells sequentially.
3. **Input Data**:
   - Ensure the dataset is placed in the specified directory and meets the expected format.
4. **Results**:
   - View the model predictions and evaluation metrics within the notebook.

## Dataset
Details about the dataset used, including its source and format, should be specified here. If the dataset is proprietary or sensitive, consider anonymizing or summarizing key aspects.

## Goals
- To develop a robust text classification model for identifying suicidal tendencies.
- To provide insights into factors or patterns commonly associated with suicidal text.

## Ethical Considerations
- The tool is intended for research and educational purposes only and should not replace professional mental health support.
- Data privacy and sensitivity are paramount; ensure ethical handling of the dataset.
